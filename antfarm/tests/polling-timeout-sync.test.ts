/**
 * Regression test: polling timeout values stay in sync
 *
 * This test was added after a bug where test assertions expected
 * timeoutSeconds=30 but the workflow.yml files had been updated to 120.
 * It reads the actual workflow.yml values and asserts they match expectations,
 * ensuring tests and config never drift apart again.
 *
 * See: https://github.com/snarktank/antfarm/issues/121
